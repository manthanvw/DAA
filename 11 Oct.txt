/*We are given an array of size n which contains the number of bananas in 
each pile. In one hour Koko can eat at most K bananas. 
If the pile contains less than K bananas in that case if Koko finishes 
all bananas of that pile then she cannot start eating bananas from another pile 
in the same hour.
Koko wants to eat all bananas within H hours. 
We are supposed to find the minimum value of K.

/*Mr.Balu is working in a metal store he has to arrange the steel boxes for saving 
space he used to insert one box into another,Every day he used to get different sized boxes,
help him to make his work simple by writing a program to find maximum number of boxes
he can put one inside the other. 

For this, You are given a 2D array of integers boxes where boxes[i] = [wi, hi] represents 
the width and the height of a box.
One box can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one box are 
greater than the other box's width and height.
Return the maximum number of boxes you can  put one inside the other.

Note: Consider only width and height of boxes.
input format : integer number n
               n number of pairs
output format : an integer n 
Example 1:
Input: 4
5 4
6 4
6 7
2 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum number of boxes you can insert is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).

Example 2:
Input: 3
1 1 
1 1
1 1
Output: 1

Example 3:
Input: 5

/*Mason work is going on at your home, and presently mason is building staircase. 
The stair case consists of k rows, where the ith row has exactly i bricks.
The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

you have n bricks and can you give the number of complete rows of the staircase mason will build.

Solve this problem in  O(logn) time complexity.

input format : an integer number
outpu format : an integer numebr

Example 1:
input= 5
output =2
Explanation :(Here B stands for brick)
B1
B2 B3
B4 B5
first row constructed with 1 brick row =1 no.of bricks =1
second row constructed with 2 bricks row=2 no.of bricks = 2
third row constructed with 2 bricks  row =3 no.of bricks =2 (incomplete row)
as third row is incomplete we are returing 2 as answer.

Example :2
input =10
output =4
Explanation:
B1
B2 B3
B4 B5 B6
B7 B8 B9 B10
all rows are completed so return 4

Example :3
input = 19
output =5*/



/*Given the array of strings S[], you need to find the longest string S 
which is the prefix of ALL the strings in the array.
Longest common prefix (LCP) for a pair of strings S1 and S2 is the 
longest string S which is the prefix of both S1 and S2.
For Example: longest common prefix of “abcdefgh” and “abcefgh” is “abc”.

Time complexity: O(NM log M)
N = Number of strings
M = Length of the longest string

Space complexity:
O(M) 
M = Length of the longest string 

Test Cases:
case1:
input=flower flow flight
output=fl

case2:
input=hello hell her he
output=he

case3:
input=anty anticipate ant antacid
output=ant
